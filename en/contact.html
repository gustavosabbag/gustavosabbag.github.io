<p>
Perhaps because I grew up in a small country town, I always wondered how
societies can function, being composed of so many people and with so many
interests. With a degree in Social Sciences, a master's degree in Political
Science and being a doctoral student in the same discipline, I understood that this
process is not something simple, and only rigorous knowledge can improve it.
That's what I chose to dedicate my life to.
